# Discription 

The project intends to offer free education and real-time university experience to inexperienced as well as professional software engineers. During COVID-19, many software engineers' lost their job, their is an enormous need for free education systems. The Online Social University project meets this requirement and is committed to offering free education to software engineers to enhance their skillset. The project is made up of different modules including a student management module, library management module, courses management module, one-on-one assistance and front-end development. The web interface enables students to register themself on the system and access the remaining components. While student management module allows administrators to manage students' records and course allocation each semester. The project is still in the form of components and the final integration of the systems is what we are currently working on.  

# Instruction to run the code

- Student and Library Management Module
     I> import projects into Netbeans Version 7.2 
     II> Link Microsoft Access Database to the Netbeans Services for the project
     III> Run the Code
     
 # Instruction to run Tests
 
Executing the NetBeans code will automatically run all test cases as well for every Jave module. We have mostly preferred performing Manual Black Box testing for these modules. Defining automated testing is our future work.
