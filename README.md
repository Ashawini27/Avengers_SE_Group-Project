# Avengers_SE_Group-Project
This is a software engineering group repository consists all codes for 'Online Social University" Project. 

We have first started with "Student Management Module" as it was the lengthiest moduel of the project. 

We are working on other modules like library management, frontend-development, and web-portal on our local system. Since, no member has expertise in github management, pushing data each time was complicating the task for us so we are pushing data on git after fishing each module.
